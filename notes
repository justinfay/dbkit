Test suite:
 - Build this on top of the sqlite3 driver in the standard library.

Rows:
 - Currently only tuple-style rows are supported. It would be nice to
   support dicts too, or, better yet, somethin akin to the sqlite3
   module's Row() factory.

Result generators:
 - Because they're currently functions, the result generators lack some
   functionality that would be nice to have, such as being able to access
   row count and the current row number.

Other missing functionality:
 - Support for callproc, executemany, nextset.
 - Is there any sense in supporting Two-Phase Commit?
