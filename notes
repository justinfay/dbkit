Rows:
 - Currently only tuple-style rows are supported. It would be nice to
   support dicts too, or, better yet, somethin akin to the sqlite3
   module's Row() factory.

Other missing functionality:
 - Support for callproc, executemany, nextset.
 - Is there any sense in supporting Two-Phase Commit?
